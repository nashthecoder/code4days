    <h2>JPGs/JPEGs</h2>
    <p>JPG are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size. This makes them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. </p>
    <img src="../img/mochi.jpg" alt="Mochi jpeg image example">
    <p><strong>CONS:</strong> JPGs don’t allow for transparent pixels, which you can see in the white edges of the image below if you look real close</p>

    <h2>GIFs</h2>
    <p>GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations</p>
    <img src="../img/mochi.gif" alt="Mochi gif image example">
    <p><strong>CONS:</strong>They’re somewhat limited in terms of color palette—never use them for photos. 
    <p>Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can’t have semi-opaque pixels.</p>
    This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background.</p>

    <h2>PNGs</h2>
    <p>PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated. 
    <p>For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye) would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file.</p>
    They deal with opacity fine, and don’t have color palette limitationsThey are good for diagrams,logos and icons</p>

    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality.</p>
    <p>This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design.</p>
    <img src="../img/mochi.svg" alt="Mochi svg image example">
    <p>For SVGs to display consistently across browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your image editor (e.g., Abode Illustrator or Sketch). If your images contain a lot of text (like the fancy screenshots in this tutorial), this can have a big impact on file size.</p>
